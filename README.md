# Portfolio

Source code for my personal portfolio website. A showcase of my work, skills, and experience as a software developer, built to be clean, fast, and reflective of how I approach building software.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
